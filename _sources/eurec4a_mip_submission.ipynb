    "# Contributing to EUREC⁴A-MIP\n",
    "\n",
    "To ease the comparison of the individual contributions and make the contributions accessible among collaborators and the broader audience, the simulation output from the EUREC⁴A-Model intercomparison will be made available on the DKRZ SWIFT storage. To use this storage efficiently and embed it within the analysis workflow the output needs to be prepared.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Creation of dataset\n",
    "    - merge output into reasonable pieces (concat along time dimension)\n",
    "    - add attributes as necessary to describe variables\n",
    "    - ensure CF-conform time variable\n",
    "    - remove duplicate entries\n",
    "- Generation of zarr files:\n",
    "    - resonable chunks (depending on typical access pattern)\n",
    "    - resonable chunk size (about 10MB)\n",
    "    - usage of `/` as `dimension_separator`\n",
    "- Upload files:\n",
    "    - either write zarr-files directly to swift-storage at DKRZ\n",
    "    - or create the zarr-files locally and upload them afterwards to the swift-storage\n",
    "    - or create tar-files, transfer to DKRZ disk space and then upload to the swift-storage\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creation\n",
    "The structure of zarr-files is fairly simple ([specifications](https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/spec/v2.html)) and can, in general, be created with any software. The easiest way to create zarr files is, however, in the python environment, especially with the xarray package:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import xarray as xr\n",
    "ds = xr.open_mfdataset(\"output_*.nc\")\n",
    "ds.to_zarr(\"output.zarr\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "A few things should be noted to create performant datasets:\n",
    "- **resonable chunks (depending on typical access pattern)**\n",
    "  - the shape of the chunks i.e. how the data is split in time and space should allow for reasonable performance for all typical access patterns. To do so, the chunks should contain data along all directions, especially along space and time to enable both fast analysis of temporal timeseries at a single point in space as well as plotting the entire domain as once at a particular time.\n",
    "- **resonable chunk size (about 10MB)**\n",
    "    - the size of the individual chunks should be about 10MB. This is a good size to make requests over the internet efficient. Decisive is the size of the compressed chunks and not the size after decompression. \n",
    "- **usage of `/` as `dimension_delimiter`**\n",
    "  - Zarr files following version spec 1 and 2 are generally containing one subfolder per variable that contain all chunks of that variable. To reduce the pressure on the filesystem, the `dimension_delimter=\"/\"` creates more subfolders such that each folder indexes only a fraction of all files. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **merge output into reasonable pieces (concat along time dimension)**\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Because the zarr-files are chunked and only those portions are loaded into memory that are actually needed at the time of calculation, huge datasets can be created without loosing performance. The user benefits from this approach because with a single load statement a lot of datasets are available. For the proposed output variables, this means, that for each category (\"2D Surface and TOA\", \"2D Integrated Variables\", \"2D fields at specified levels\", \"3D fields\") only one dataset (zarr-file) should be created.\n",
    "  If the temporal or spatial resolution differs for some variables, these variables should be written to an additional dataset. It should be avoided to have two time/height coordinates per dataset (i.e. there should only be one time coordinate `time` and no `time2`)\n",
    "  \n",
    "  A dataset should always contain all timesteps from the beginning of the simulation until its end.\n",
    "- **rename the variable names to the ones given in the specific documents ([LES](https://eurec4a.eu/fileadmin/user_upload/eurec4a/Simulations/EUREC4A_LEM_Model_Output.pdf), [SRM](https://eurec4a.eu/fileadmin/user_upload/eurec4a/Simulations/EUREC4A_SRM_Model_Output.pdf))**\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Having consistent variable names across models significantly increases the user experience when analysing and comparing the output\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  ds = ds.rename({\"model_var1\":\"eurec4amip_var1\", \"model_var2\":\"eurec4amip_var2\"})\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- **add attributes as necessary to describe variables**\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  ds.u10.attrs[\"standard_name\"] = \"eastward_wind\"\n",
    "  ds.u10.attrs[\"units\"] = \"ms-1\"\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- **ensure CF-conform time variable**\n",
    "    The time unit should be CF-conform such that it is easily understood by common tools. In particular, the following should work:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    ds.sel(time=slice(\"2020-01-20 00:00:00\", \"2020-02-01 00:00:00\"))\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "- **remove duplicate entries**\n",
    "  Please check the output for any duplicate timesteps and check that the time is monotonic increasing\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  ds = ds.drop_duplicates(dim=\"time\")\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Upload\n",
    "zarr-files are great to upload to object stores like the swift-storage at DKRZ or Azure Blobs, Google Buckets and Amazon S3. Due to their structure, every single chunk is saved as a separate object. On a file storage system, currently the standard on HPC systems for climate simulations, these chunks are the individual files within a zarr directory:\n",

Examples are `ICON_LES_control_312m`, `HARMONIE_SRM_warming_624m` or in general following the schema `<model>_<setup>_<experiment>_<resolution>`. The filename can follow the same principle and just add `_<subset>` e.g. `ICON_LES_control_312m_3D` or `HARMONIE_SRM_warming_624m_2D`. In general, the container and filenames are not of importance because the files will be referenced through the [EUREC4A intake catalog](https://github.com/eurec4a/eurec4a-intake) where they will get a meaningful name. Nevertheless, for users who want to download the datasets themselves a bit of structure is nice.\n",
