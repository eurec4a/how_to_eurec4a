    "Cloud Botany is a library of idealised large-eddy simulations forced by and initialised with combinations of simplified vertical profiles. Each profile is parameterised by variables which aim to make the ensemble span a range of conditions corresponding to the variability observed over the EUREC<sup>4</sup>A region during the boreal winter of 2019/2020. The following table lists these varied parameters and their ranges:\n",
