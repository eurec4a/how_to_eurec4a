We want to do this using a similar approach, but one thing is different: we do need to care about each individual data point within a cloud, so we need to do many aggregations across differently sized sets of data. That is not something which seems to be expressible in a vectorized way at first sight. Nonetheless, there are some ways of accomplishing our goal.\n",
