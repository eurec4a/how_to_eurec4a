    "| 0 | Raw dataset as CSV file. No geo-referenced data, just plain labels in pixel coordinates. Includes house-keeping files. Use this dataset for analyzing the technical aspects of labels, e.g. how long did it take a person to draw a particular label. |\n",
    "| 1 | Georeferenced dataset. Only base points of the labels are given, e.g. lat0, lon0, lat1, lon1. Use this dataset for developing your own ideas where no filled masks ( see next levels ) are needed. |\n",
    "| 2 | Like level 1, but with labels being converted to masks. This dataset is easier to query if a particular position has been classified with a particular pattern or not. |\n",
    "| 3 | This processing level contains the information on how often a pattern has been classified at a specific point in time and space for each workflow (IR, VIS, ICON). To retrieve these frequencies, the level 2 data has been resampled to individual (`instant`) and daily (`daily`) composites. The `instant` dataset can be used for studies of the diurnal cycle or for analyses where the sub-daily temporal evolution is of importance. The `daily` composite give a good overview about the daily situation. It should be noted though that in case of the `daily` composite, overlapping labels of one pattern from one particular person are only counted once towards the frequency. If one person has classified for example Flowers several times a day at the same location, it is only counted once towards the frequency to reduce the bias towards the perception of a single participant. |\n",
