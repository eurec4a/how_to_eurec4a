# How-To cite the EUREC$^4$A datasets

This How-To book is based on two main components, the EUREC$^4$A Intake catalog and the datasets referenced therein.

The EUREC$^4$ Intake catalog is published at [![](https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.8422321.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8422321) and can be cited accordingly.
Please note however that this is a collection DOI and will always point to the most recent published version of the catalog.
