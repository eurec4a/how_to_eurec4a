# KT19 dataset

The ... dataset is ...

More information on the dataset can be found in [Konow et al. (2019)](https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-11-921-2019). If you have questions or if you would like to use the data for a publication, please don't hesitate to get in contact with the dataset authors as stated in the dataset attributes `contact` or `author`.

```{code-cell} ipython3
%pylab inline
```

## Get data
* To load the data we first load the EUREC4A meta data catalogue. More information on the catalog can be found [here](https://github.com/eurec4a/eurec4a-intake#eurec4a-intake-catalogue).

```{code-cell} ipython3
import eurec4a
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
cat = eurec4a.get_intake_catalog()
list(cat.HALO.KT19)
```

* We can funrther specify the platform, instrument, if applicable dataset level or variable name, and pass it on to dask.

*Note: have a look at the attributes of the xarray dataset `ds` for all relevant information on the dataset, such as author, contact, or citation infromation.*

```{code-cell} ipython3
ds = cat.HALO.KT19.cloudmask['HALO-0205'].to_dask()
ds
```

## Load HALO flight phase information
All HALO flights were split up into flight phases or segments to allow for a precise selection in time and space of a circle or calibration pattern. For more information have a look at the respective [github repository](https://github.com/eurec4a/halo-flight-phase-separation).

```{code-cell} ipython3
meta = eurec4a.get_flight_segments()
```

We select the flight phase we are interested in, e.g. the second circle on February 5 by itâ€™s segment_id.

```{code-cell} ipython3
segments = {s["segment_id"]: {**s, "flight_id": flight["flight_id"]}
             for platform in meta.values()
             for flight in platform.values()
             for s in flight["segments"]
            }
seg = segments["HALO-0205_c2"]
```

We transfer the information from our flight segment selection to our radar and radiometer data in the xarray dataset.

```{code-cell} ipython3
ds_selection = ds.sel(time=slice(seg["start"], seg["end"]))
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
plt.figure()
ds_selection.cloud_mask.plot(figsize=(14,4))
```

## Plots

+++

We plot reflectivity from the HAMP Radar, the flight altitude of HALO, relative humdity measurements from the dropsondes and brightness temperatures from the low-frequency channels along the 22 GHz water vapor line (K band) from the HAMP radiometer.
